## Assignment
For this cumulative assessment on React, you will select and complete one of the following Frontend Mentor  challenges:

2. [**URL Shortening API Landing Page**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G): Create a landing page that integrates with the [bitly API](https://dev.bitly.com/)  to shorten URLs, featuring a list of shortened links and the ability to copy them to the clipboard.
- [Click here to download the starter files.](https://ps-lms.vercel.app/curriculum-assets/414/url-shortening-api-master.zip)
- **Important Note**: Due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies causing errors with the originally suggested [CleanURI](https://cleanuri.com/)  API, we have modified this project to use the [bitly ](https://bitly.com/) API.

The code, briefs, and images for each challenge are included within this module as well, for reference. You should use the material included with this module, just in case the challenges changes in scope or [*sic*]

This project aims to assess your ability to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course in a practical, real-world scenario. Choose the challenge that best aligns with your interests and strengths, and demonstrate your proficiency in front-end development.

### Look Famililar?
If you have completed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules with Per Scholas, you may be familiar with these project starters. As part of this project, you will be required to use React, but the project will be very similar to the projects you completed in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules.

To challenge yourself, try to complete the project without using too much of the code from your previous projects. Or, if you are feeling ambitious, complete one (or both!) of the options you have not yet worked on.
